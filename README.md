# Investigation-on-TMDb
This proyect consists on the investigation of four different questions for analysis on a dataset from The Movie Database (TMDb) with information about 10,865 movies.
After the assesing and cleaning of the dataset, we made visualizations to answer the questions for analysis.

This was my first proyect as part of the Udacity course "Data Analyst".
